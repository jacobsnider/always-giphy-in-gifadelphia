## DESCRIPTION

"It's Always Giphy in Gifadelphia" is a simple website built for a laugh. It displays a random gif from the television show *It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia* which can then be updated upon an on-click event. 

As this project was created for Code Louisville's January 2021 JavaScript course I've noted requirements for the project below.

The original project I intended to turn in was a Discord Bot with similar functionality. If you would like to take a look over that project it can be found here:

##REQUIREMENTS

    - You application must have a responsive design through the use of media queries, Bootstrap, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and/or other similar approaches - we need to ensure that you can integrate your new JavaScript skill with your HTML/CSS skills you previously learned

    - Project is uploaded to your GitHub repository and shows at minimum 5 separate commits

    - Project includes a README file that explains the following:
    A one paragraph or longer description of what your project is
    Which 3+ features you have included from the below lists to meet the requirements

    - Choose at least 3 items on the Features List below and implement them in your project


## FEATURES

###### *Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX)

The Giphy API is utilized to retrieve relevant gifs. 

###### *Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application

An array is created from parsed JSON, that data is passed to a randomizer function which picks a random gif from the array then displays it on the site. 


## NOTES
Pull the project locally and preview the index.html in a browser. Click to display a new random gif.
